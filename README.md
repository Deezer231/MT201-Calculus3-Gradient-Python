# MT201-Calculus3-Gradient-Python

## Overview
Phython real life intigration of jupyterhub concepts i learned in university in my Calculus 3 module. 
In my class we were amde to write sagemath phython in jupyterhub files to see the outputs and core concepts which i was facinatsed by the use of code to solve maths problems so after class i  researched how to  write “real” Python code for these mathematical concepts, outside the notebook environment. This project is the result: a simple, organized Python repo that computes gradients and directional derivatives using SymPy, and prints the results in a clear, classroom-style format.




# MT201-Calculus3-Gradient-Python

## Overview

This project is a real-life integration of JupyterHub concepts I learned in my university Calculus 3 module.  
In class, we wrote SageMath and Python code in JupyterHub notebooks to explore mathematical ideas and see outputs interactively. I was fascinated by how code could solve math problems, so after class I researched how to write “real” Python code for these concepts outside the notebook environment.

This repository is the result: a simple, organized Python project that computes gradients and directional derivatives using SymPy, and prints the results in a clear, classroom-style format.
